Kedai 9/10, owned by Mr. Arifin, has experienced growth since 2019 but faces challenges due to inadequate financial bookkeeping practices. 
Without a structured bookkeeping system, the cafe struggles to track income and expenses, hindering financial analysis and strategic decision-making. 
The proposed solution is to implement a manual bookkeeping system using Excel templates to record sales, purchases, and other expenses. 
Additionally, training and mentoring will be provided to ensure Mr. Arifin and his staff understand and effectively use this system, with the hope of improving the overall performance of the cafe.
